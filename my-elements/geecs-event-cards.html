  <div id="mentor" class = "invisible" >  
      We created out mentor/mentee program to  
      support female EECS with a mentor or mentee to assist in their academic, social, and career decisions. 
      We support a wide range of students: from undeclared students who are interested in EECS, to 
      declared students, to graduate students. 
      
      <h3> How it works</h3>
      We match mentors and mentees based on
      interests, goals, experience etc. Pairs are given freedom to do whatever they want, though mentees and 
      mentors are asked to meet at least three times a semester. Since meeting up at a cafe seems to work well, 
      we provide Mujo's vouchers for free beverages for the pair to enjoy as they get to know each other and learn.
      
      <h3> For UMich Students</h3>
      The 2013-2014 mentee/mentor application is now closed. Please check back later this year. The application will also be
      in the weekly email once we open up the program.
      
      <h3> For Others Interested in Mentoring</h3>
        If you aren't affiliated with UMich and would like to help out, please let us know by shooting us an email at
        geecs.officers@umich.edu. We would be thrilled to expand our program. 
    </div>
   
    <div id="girlsCode" class="invisible" >
      We beleive it's important to raise interest in technology early on in a fun and helpful environment. That's why we began our {GirlsCode} 
      series of events in fall 2013. We invited twenty high school girls for an afternoon of technology related events (and free lunch of course!).
      Our first event was wonderfully successful - not only were the students able to explore their interest in EECS, but our 
      members were able to share their share thier hard-earned knowledge and have a good time. 
      
      <h3> Fall 2013: Programming with Processing (CS)</h3>
      For our first event, we held a workshop to introduce girls to programming. We used <a href="http://www.processing.org" target="_blank">Processing</a>, 
      a programming language based on Java that aims to teach computer science in a fun, visual way. After teach the girls the basics of variables, functions, and loops,
      they were able to use Processing to draw and animate to their hearts content. 
      
      
      <h3> Winter 2014: Arduinos (EE) </h3>
      
      For our second event, we decided to hold an <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/" target="_blank">Arduino</a> workshop to teach girl
      s about hardware and electrical engineering. This was a learning experience for many of our members as well,
      as they'd never worked with Arduinos either.
      During the workshop, the high school students worked together to learn about circuits, programming, and microcontrollers.
      They hooked up LEDs, potentiometers, and a speaker to a breadboard 
      and an Arduino, and were able to experiment with different combinations of circuits and to make tweaks in the Arduino code.

    </div>
    
    
    <div id="other" class="invisible" >  
      Of course, we hold a variety of other events too, from profesional to academic to social. We try for at least one 
      gEECS event a month. In the past we've worked with many other student organizations, from the Society of Women Engineers
      to WolverineSoft. If you have an event you'd like us to know about, or if you have a suggestion for future events, please 
      email us at geecs.officers@umich.edu.
